                I think there is a few people who notice this beggining of disaster. 
                    
                There are seven friends in your chatting room.
                And.. Um.. @@ is weird... 
                Guess who is the infectee, isnâ€™ it easy? 
                    
                But although you know who is the infectee, you cannot save the world. 
                So, Don't worry if you can't find an infected person. 
                Feel easy@@!
